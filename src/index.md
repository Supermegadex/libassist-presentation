# The Problem

**BAD DOCS**

---

# What is LibAssist?
#### LibAssist is two things:

1. A text-based documentation format (LADoc)
2. An app that displays files written in such a format

---

# LibAssist Documentation (LADoc)

* Markdown with **annotations**.
* Annotations are blocks of YAML that describe parts of the content
* Code blocks can be extended with annotations to create *examples*.
  * Multiple files in a group
  * Specify directory or template to abstract for readers
  * Runnable and editable

---

### Example: Project Annotation

```yaml
+++project
name: LibAssist
package: com.supermegadex.libassist
description: An all-in-one documentation solution
assets: pictures
+++
```
